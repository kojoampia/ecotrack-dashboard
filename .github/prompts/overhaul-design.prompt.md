I will overhaul the design of the **EcoTrack Pro** dashboard to implement a premium **Dark + Emerald** aesthetic. This update includes a deep slate background, glassmorphism card effects, and high-contrast emerald accents to ensure the compliance data stands out with a modern, high-tech feel.

I have completely redesigned the application to follow a "Cyber-Industrial Dark + Emerald" theme. The key changes include:

1. **Immersive Dark Aesthetic:** Switched the background to a deep slate (`#050505`) and utilized translucent glass backgrounds for cards to create depth.
2. **High-Performance Typography:** Leveraged high-weight Inter font (900/Black) for metrics and table headers to ensure critical compliance data is immediately scannable.
3. **Emerald Accents:** Used a vibrant Emerald-500 for primary actions, shadows, and progress indicators, creating a "clean-tech" visual language.
4. **UX Fixes:** \* Refined table cell padding and spacing.

- Improved component isolation with subtle borders (`white/5`).
- Added smooth entry animations (`animate-in`) for the AI sections and toast notifications.
- Optimized Material component colors (Select, Toolbar, Buttons) to match the custom theme.

The dashboard now feels like an enterprise-grade control center for a 2026 sustainability office.
