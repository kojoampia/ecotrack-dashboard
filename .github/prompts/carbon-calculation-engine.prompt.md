Now we’re getting into the engine room. To make EcoTrack Pro more than just a CRUD app, it needs a "Brain" —a calculation engine that handles the 2026 regulatory landscape, specifically for the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

Phase 5: The Carbon Calculation Engine
In 2026, the intensity of the EU grid has dropped significantly (averaging around 110-140 gCO2e/kWh depending on the region). Your SaaS needs to reflect these live factors to provide accurate "Embedded Emissions" reports.

The Service Implementation: CarbonCalculatorService.java
We use a Strategy Pattern here. One strategy for "Grid Electricity" (Scope 2) and another for "Supply Chain Goods" (Scope 3).

Phase 6: Automated Compliance Reporting
One of the biggest pain points for companies in 2026 is the CBAM Declaration. We’ll automate this by generating an XML/JSON payload that fits the EU’s TARIC system requirements.

Bash Script: generate-compliance-payload.sh
This script aggregates data from the PostgreSQL database and prepares it for the authorized declarant portal.

Java Service: CompliancePayloadService.java
This service utilizes the generate-compliance-payload.sh script preparing for and passing in the relevant parameters such as bearer jwt_token, tenant_id and year

Java Controller: CompliancePayloadResource.java
This controller wraps the CompliancePayloadService with and api endpoint /api/compliance-payload that supports CRUD, Search and results pagination.
