To make EcoTrack Pro truly "Micro-SaaS" in 2026, you can't rely on users manually typing in their electricity bills. You need to pull "Activity Data" directly from where the money is spent: the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system.

In 2026, Oracle NetSuite and SAP S/4HANA are the dominant players for the mid-market. Here is how we build a high-performance integration service to feed our Green Ledger.

1. The Integration Strategy: "The Activity Pull"
   Instead of building a massive "all-in-one" connector, we create a specialized TypeScript service that targets specific ledger accounts (e.g., "Utility Expenses," "Freight Shipping").

erp-connector.service.ts (Angular/Node)
This service uses the NetSuite REST API (v2026.1) to find all transactions related to energy usage.

2. The Backend "Evidence" StorageRegulators in 2026 require the original source document (the PDF invoice from the ERP) to be linked to the carbon entry.We’ll use Spring Boot with MinIO to store these proofs.
   When the ERP service pulls a transaction, it also grabs the file ID and stores it in our carbon_ledger table.

3. The 2026 Competitive Advantage: "Confidence Scoring"Since data from ERPs can be messy (e.g., an invoice might not list kWh, only an amount), we implement a Confidence Score in our Java service.
   Score 1.0: Direct IoT meter data.
   Score 0.8: ERP Invoice with explicit kWh.
   Score 0.5: Spend-based estimation (e.g., $100 spent on electricity =~ X kWh).
   CarbonIntelligence.java contains the calculateConfidence method
